just some notes to help me flesh out how i can support all potential types of frequencies

1. every blank blanks (every 2 months)
	- unit (months, weeks, years, days)
	- frequency (number)
	- date_info
		- number 1..28 (months)
		- enum 1..7 (weeks)
		- calendar date (years)
		- calendar date (days)

2. blank a blank (twice a month, 3 times a week)
	- unit (months, weeks, years)
	- frequeny always 1
	-date_info
		- [number 1..28] (months)
		- [enum 1..7] (weeks)
		- [calendar date] (years)

3. once
	- calendar date
